# QS-FixedSideNav-Mashup

## Installation

Desktop: copy files to a directory under My Documents/Qlik/Sense/Extensions

Server: zip files and install in the QMC


In total you can add 23 QV objects.

I have designed the pages to represent the following objects

* Home - 8 kpi's and 1 map object.

* KPIs - 1 bar chart, 3 orizontal guage charts and 3 pie charts.

* Details - 1 scatter plot, 1 map, 2 pie charts and 2 line chart.

Above is to give an idea, you can use the objects according to your requirements and App design.
